## Features

* The player can battle random, wild Pokemon. During battle, the player has the option to defend, attack, or use an item. 
* The player can purchase items from the Poke Mart and use those items to help them in battle or to catch a wild Pokemon. 
* When players visit Nurse Joy, they have the option to heal their Pokemon so they can continuously battle and play the game. 
* Attacks are more or less effective based on the type of Pokemon. For example, water Pokemon will have stronger attacks against fire Pokemon. 
* The chances of catching a wild Pokemon are dependent on the type of pokeball the player uses, with the Master Pokeball having the best odds.
